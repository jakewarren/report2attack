            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This report details a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign attributed to APT29
                (also known as Cozy Bear) targeting government agencies in Europe and North America
                during Q4 2023. The campaign demonstrates advanced tradecraft and multiple stages
                of intrusion.

        <section id="initial-access">
            <h2>Initial Access</h2>
            <p>
                The attackers initiated the campaign through spearphishing emails containing
                malicious PDF attachments. These emails were carefully crafted to appear as
                legitimate diplomatic communications, leveraging current geopolitical events
                to increase their success rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon opening the PDF attachment, a macro-enabled document was extracted and
                executed, establishing the initial foothold. The malicious macro utilized
                obfuscated PowerShell commands to download the next-stage payload from a
                compromised legitimate website.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="execution">
            <h2>Execution and Persistence</h2>
            <p>
                The PowerShell script executed several commands to establish persistence.
                First, it created a scheduled task that would run daily at system startup,
                ensuring the malware maintained access even after system reboots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the attackers modified Windows registry keys to enable further
                execution capabilities and disable certain security features. The malware
                also injected code into legitimate Windows processes to avoid detection.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="credential-access">
            <h2>Credential Harvesting</h2>
            <p>
                Once established, the attackers deployed credential dumping tools to extract
                credentials from LSASS memory. They also utilized keylogging capabilities to
                capture passwords entered by users during normal operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stolen credentials were then used to access additional systems within the
                network using legitimate authentication mechanisms, making the lateral movement
                difficult to distinguish from normal administrative activity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="lateral-movement">
            <h2>Lateral Movement</h2>
            <p>
                Using the harvested credentials, APT29 moved laterally across the network using
                Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
                This allowed them to access high-value targets including file servers and domain
                controllers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="collection">
            <h2>Data Collection and Exfiltration</h2>
            <p>
                The attackers collected sensitive documents from compromised systems, focusing
                on classified materials and strategic planning documents. Files were compressed
                into encrypted archives before exfiltration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data exfiltration occurred through HTTPS connections to attacker-controlled
                infrastructure, disguised as normal web traffic. The attackers used cloud
                storage services as an additional exfiltration channel, uploading stolen
                data to compromised cloud accounts.
            </p>

        <section id="recommendations">
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement strict email filtering and disable macros by default</li>
                <li>Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions</li>
                <li>Enable PowerShell logging and monitor for suspicious commands</li>
                <li>Implement multi-factor authentication across all systems</li>
                <li>Regular security awareness training for employees</li>
            </ul>
